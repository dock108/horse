- ‚úÖ Web scraper module with base class and track-specific scrapers
- ‚úÖ Configuration management via YAML
- ‚úÖ Alert engine with multiple evaluator types
- ‚úÖ Email notification system with templates
- ‚úÖ Main application with scheduler
- ‚úÖ Basic test suite
- ‚úÖ System runs end-to-end

### ‚úÖ Completed (Documentation - 09/13/25)
- 7 comprehensive issue documents created (retroactive)
- Project status documentation
- Updated README and plan
- UAT testing guide prepared

### üîÑ In Progress
- Awaiting User Acceptance Testing
- Ready for real track integration

### ‚è≥ Upcoming
- User testing with live data
- Real track URL configuration
- Performance optimization based on testing
- Optional dashboard implementation

## Project Metrics

### Planning Phase
- **Duration**: 1 day (2025-09-13)
- **Deliverables**: 7 issues, 4 documentation files

**Note**: All issues show "Awaiting User Testing" in their individual files per CLAUDE.md guidelines

## Technical Stack Decisions

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup4 + Requests
- **Configuration**: YAML + python-dotenv
- **Testing**: pytest
- **Platform**: macOS

### Architecture Pattern
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Configuration-driven behavior
- Event-based alert system
- Singleton pattern for configuration and database

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks
1. **Scraper Reliability** (Medium)
   - Impact: Data collection interruption
   - Mitigation: Robust error handling, multiple retry strategies

2. **Email Delivery** (Low)
   - Impact: Missed alerts
   - Mitigation: SMTP with TLS, retry logic, queue system

3. **Performance at Scale** (Low)
   - Impact: Slow queries with large datasets
   - Mitigation: Database indices, data retention policies

### Resolved Risks
- Architecture uncertainty (resolved with detailed plan)
- Data model complexity (resolved with normalized schema)

## Resource Requirements

### Development Environment
- macOS with Python 3.11+
- 2GB free disk space
- Internet connection for scraping
- SMTP credentials for email

### Runtime Requirements
- Memory: < 200MB
- CPU: Minimal (< 5% average)
- Network: Intermittent (scraping intervals)
- Storage: ~100MB/month of data

## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality Targets
- Test coverage: ‚â• 80%
- Documentation: All public methods
- Linting: Zero errors (flake8)
- Type hints: All function signatures

### Performance Targets
- Scrape time: < 5s per track
- DB query: < 100ms
- Alert evaluation: < 1s
- Email send: < 5s

## Stakeholder Communication

### Documentation Available
- [README](../README.md): Project overview
- [Plan](../plan.md): Detailed implementation plan
- [Issues Index](../issues/ISSUES_INDEX.md): All implementation tasks
- [UAT Guide](./UAT_GUIDE.md): Testing procedures

### Next Steps for Stakeholders
1. Review implementation issues
2. Confirm technology choices
3. Approve to begin development
4. Set up test environment

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundations (Current)
- **Start**: Ready to begin
